## [1.1.0]

- **Breaking change :** `Geolocation.requestLocationPermission` now takes a named parameter for permission
- **Breaking change :** New `GeolocationResultErrorType.permissionNotGranted` type. Previous meaning for `permissionDenied` is now divided in two different states:
  - `permissionNotGranted`: User didn't accept nor decline the locationn permission request yet
  - `permissionDenied`: User specifically declined the permission request
- Ability to open settings when requesting permission, and user already declined the permission previously: `Geolocation.requestLocationPermission(openSettingsIfDenied: true)` (opening the settings as fallback is now the default behaviour).
